# Эмулятор калькулятора "Электроника C3-15"

This project is a web-based emulator for the vintage Soviet calculator "Elektronika S3-15".

This project was initially bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and has been migrated to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a faster and more modern development experience.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits (Hot Module Replacement is enabled).
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).\
It runs all tests and provides a summary in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run preview`

Runs a local server to preview the production build from the `dist` folder. This is useful for checking the final build before deployment.
